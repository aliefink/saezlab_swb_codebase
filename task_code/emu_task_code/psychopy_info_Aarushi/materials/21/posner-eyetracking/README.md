Posner cueing task with eye tracking responses
===============================================

Thnis is a demo of how to make a gaze contingent paradigm using the built in eye tracking components in builder view. This builds on the Posner task developed in previous chapters. Note that you don't *need* an eye tracker plugged in to develop an eye tracking paradigm. You can make your experiment using MouseGaze, which uses the mouse movements and responses to simulate movements and blinks!
