Muller-Lyer illusion using sliders
==================================

This is a demo of how to use sliders in PsychoPy, although perhaps in a non-conventional way. In this task we use sliders to manipulate the size of a line in order to measure participants susceptibility to a perceptual illusion - the Muller Lyer illusion. 

The task
--------------

On each trial participants were presdented with a line that is top and tailed with either outward or inward facing arrow heads. they must then use a slider to adjust the size of an adjustable line to match the length of the reference line. The Muller Lyer illusion occurs when participants percieve lines with inward facing arrow heads to be shorter than those with outward facing arrow heads.
