Exercise 6.2: Make a set of rotating eyes
=========================================

This is another cool example of how we can make and use dynamic stimuli in PsychoPy. A set of rotating eyes is something you might think you *need* a movie for - but it isn't! here we create 4 circles, a set of white eyes and a set of pupils (make sure to draw the pupils *after* the eyes so that they appear on top!), then set the position field of th pupils to update every frame, with a bit of math you can then make the pupils move in the pattern that you wish!
