Image reveal opacity
===============================================

This is a basic demo of changing stimulus parameters dynamically, here we dynamically reveal an image by increasing its opacity from 0 to 1. If we are changing something dynamically, we make sure to set that field to "set every frame" because want our image to be fully opaque at 5 seconds, we can utilise the variable `t` that exists "under the hood" of all PsychoPy experiments and set the opacity field of the image to be `t/5`. Remember *t represents the time in seconds since the start of the routine*.
