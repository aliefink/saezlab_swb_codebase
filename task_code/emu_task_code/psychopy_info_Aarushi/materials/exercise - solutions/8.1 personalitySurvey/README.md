Exercise 8.1 Make a personality questionaire
=============================================================

In this Chapter we made a somewhat silly questionaire in order to familiarise ourslves with PsychoPys form component. Let's but these skills to the test to make something a bit more serious. 

Solution
------------------------

First we pick a scale from the IPIP website, here we have gone for a simplitic scale of cheerfulness. Step one whenmaking any form is to put together a list of form items in a spreadsheet. Remember, *if you can't remember the headers you need for PsychoPys form you can always click the icon next to the "items" field and that will open you up a template*. 

We will assign our first row to be a simple description of the task and then use the remaining rows to present our 10 questions. All of these questions are "choice" response types.
