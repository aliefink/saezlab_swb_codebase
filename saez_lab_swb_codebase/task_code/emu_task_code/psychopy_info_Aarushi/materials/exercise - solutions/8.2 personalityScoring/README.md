Exercise 8.2 Set up the questionaire for scoring
=============================================================

On our personality scale some items are scored along a positive scale and some along a negative scale, let's keep track of the participants score. 

Solution
------------------------

Here we just need to make a slight change to the way our form spreadsheet is set out. we instead put our options as "ticklabels" then we can assign the tick values as either ascending (for positively scored items) or descending (for negatively scored items).
